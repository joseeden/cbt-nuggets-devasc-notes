## OOP ##

It is an architectural style supported by many programming languages. The key concept of OOP is the use of ***'OBJECTS'*** which are instances of a class

Objects in OOP can be created, destroyed, and manipulated in **ISOLATION** from one another.

You can work on different objects separately - each won't affect the other.

It also supports **DRY** and **KISS**

    DRY     Don't Repeat yourself 
    KISS    Keep It Simple, Stupid.

## How does OOP supports DRY and KISS? ##

**Maintainable**
Easily fix, update, change, and maintain code over time

**Debuggable**
Fixing bugs within code, easily isolating problems in a code
    
**Testable**
Code should have automated unit testing.
    
**Legible**
Often neglected, your code should be readable by other human beings.

**SUMMARY**

All these individual objects must still be able to come together to form somethingmore powerful than the sum of its parts.
